    "\n",
    "1. Write a function (template below) that performs a random walk on a lattice (with spacing $a=1$ for simplicity) in $d$ dimensions. It should work for at least d=1,2,3 but perhaps works for any number of dimensions. \n",

    "If possible, extract the Diffusion constant $D$, by fitting the relationship $\\langle \\delta x(t)^2 \\rangle = 2 d D t$, where $t$ is the number of steps in the random walk. To do this, you should be able to use one of a variety pre-built python module that can do linear regression. "
