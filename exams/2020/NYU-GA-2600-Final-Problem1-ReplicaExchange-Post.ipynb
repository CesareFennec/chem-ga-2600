    " - In my simulations, I first equilibrated for $t=100$ at teach temperature before starting the replica exchange\n",
    " - I ended up attempting an exchange every 50 MD steps (with dt = 0.1)\n",
    " - I ran until I had made 10000 swap attempts\n",
    " - Compute statistics from samples at a particular temperature, not in a particular replica, which moves up and down. It's easier to generate $N$ trajectories at the $N$ temperatures from the first place during the algorithm, but you will have to figure out the best way to do that part \n",
    " - If you get memory errors, try increasing `save_frequency` (i.e. save configurations and energies less often), it probably doesn't have to be too small\n",
